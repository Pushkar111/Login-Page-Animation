# Animated Login Form Using HTML, CSS, JS

This project is an animated login page designed to provide a visually engaging user experience. It features interactive animations that respond to user inputs, such as entering a name, email, and agreeing to terms via a checkbox. The animations include moving gears, a spraying hand, and other SVG elements that create a dynamic and playful interface.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Form Validation** : The form fields validate user input in real-time, providing visual feedback when the input is valid.
- **Animated SVG Elements** : Various SVG elements, such as gears and a spraying hand, animate in response to user interactions.
- **Responsive Design** : The layout adjusts to fit different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
